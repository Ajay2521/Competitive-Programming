## LeetCode - 

### Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.

### Example 1:

`Input: n = 3`
`Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]`

### Example 2:

`Input: n = 5`
`Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

### Example 3:

`Input: n = 15`
`Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]`

## CodeChef

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 

But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. Print a new line after each string or number

### HackerRank , HackerEarth - Consider the following problem:

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
Write a solution (or reduce an existing one) so it has as few characters as possible.

## Interviewbit 

Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem.

Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. 

But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. 

For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

Look at the example for more details.

## Example

`A = 5`
`Return: [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]`
